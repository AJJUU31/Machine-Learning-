# Machine-Learning-
To perform handwriting recognition on cheques, two machine learning algorithms, a Support Vector Machine and Convolutional Neural Network, were used. The algorithms were trained on a large dataset known as ‘NIST Special Database-19’ and then used to acquire and detect characteristics from the dataset, such as the words, numbers written in different ways. The process involved pre-processing the images, extracting features, and then training and testing the models to achieve high accuracy. After performing two different machine learning for handwriting recognition, the CNN model performs best compared to SVM.
Outcome: Achieved Distinction
